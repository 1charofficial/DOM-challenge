The DOM challenge. 

There are a few different levels to this challenge:
Level 1 - Make a number of boxes (defined in the code) appear on the screen.
Level 2 - Allow the user to specify how many boxes they want on the screen and display that on the screen.
Level 3 - Allow the user to clear all boxes via a clear boxes button.

*Add images dynamically to boxes using unsplash query:  https://source.unsplash.com/random/500x500/?sig=<randomNum>&<query> *bold needs modifying*

//I need to produce a number of boxes (pre-determined). 

//I then need to be able to produce boxes on request of the user.

//I need to then let the user request a type of image as well as a number of images.

//I need to connect the number of things and the type of things to the image generator, im thinking of a loop, that can run the function 
//a number of times based on the users request.

//a function to feed back images based on two queries

//a function to make the feeding of images happen - event - on click

//a function to clear the screen - an event - onclick

//a function to re start the function that took the queries so it starts from a fresh
