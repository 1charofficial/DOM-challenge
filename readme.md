The DOM challenge. 

There are a few different levels to this challenge:
Level 1 - Make a number of boxes (defined in the code) appear on the screen.
Level 2 - Allow the user to specify how many boxes they want on the screen and display that on the screen.
Level 3 - Allow the user to clear all boxes via a clear boxes button.
